The first step in exam preparation is to find out as much information about your exam as possible. This will help you with your planning of a revision timetable.Make sure you know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the exam will be held</li>
                    <li>Where it will be held</li>
                    <li>How much time will be available to complete the exam</li>
                    <li>How the exam will be structured (and/or what type of exam it will be); (See section on different types of exams)</li>
                    <li>What you can take into the exam room</li><li>If you can look at past exam papers</li>
                    <li>The percentage of total marks that the exam is worth</li></ul></div>

                <p>Revision is an ongoing and cumulative process. It is not wise to leave revision until the night before the exam. You should revise after each lecture and tutorial. Plan your revision across the semester.Good planning and effective preparation will mean that you will not need any last minute cramming efforts.
